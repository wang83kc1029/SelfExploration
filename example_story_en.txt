At the beginning of last year, when I was about to complete four years of work, I decided to quit my job and travel because I was tired of the work environment. Although my colleagues, friends and family were very supportive of me, I was actually full of fear. I was not sure what I would get, whether it was what I wanted, or even whether I really longed for it. It seems not. I just have the mentality of "many people have been abroad and seen it, many people are full of longing for Europe and the United States, so I might as well go and see what it is actually like." Or to be more precise, I am just escaping from the depressing environment in Taiwan.

I felt a lot of loneliness during the process, and even felt anxious and afraid. I felt like what I was doing was meaningless and that I was just taking pictures everywhere to prove that I had been to these places, to gain some attention, and to delay my career. However, looking back now, perhaps these loneliness and meaninglessness are telling me that life has many aspects, and even a desirable journey does not only have a glamorous side. Sometimes you will be amazed by the different landscapes, cultures and people, but sometimes, like when you are dragging your luggage to catch the bus, climbing up and down to find tourist attractions, using a very slow and unreliable mobile network to look up words in a language you don’t understand, and having to stay alert in an unfamiliar environment and observe your surroundings, and finally arriving at the hotel exhausted like a dog, you really wonder what you are doing here.

But if you ask me now about my original decision, I think I would go out again. I even want to go abroad again now. I think it’s the people. After meeting many travelers from all over the world, I found that perhaps the meaning of traveling to me is to hear and see with my own eyes people from different backgrounds. In their seemingly glamorous journeys, they have actually experienced or are experiencing difficulties and challenges in life, but they still did not give up and continued to look for answers in life.

Thank you for sharing your story so openly; it takes courage to reflect on such deep emotions and experiences. I can sense the complexity in your journey—your desire for exploration intertwined with feelings of fear, loneliness, and uncertainty. It’s perfectly natural to have mixed emotions, especially when embarking on a significant change like traveling to unfamiliar places.

In your narrative, a few underlying negative beliefs can be identified:

Fear of Meaninglessness: You mentioned feeling that your journey was meaningless and that you were simply taking photos for attention. This belief can often stem from societal expectations about what travel 'should' be and can create a sense of inadequacy if your experience doesn’t align with those ideals.

Escape Rather Than Exploration: It sounds like part of your motivation to travel was to escape a disappointing work environment. While this can be a valid reason to seek change, it may lead to feelings of emptiness if the underlying issues aren’t addressed.

Comparison with Others: The feeling that you should be experiencing the same joy or fulfillment that others seem to derive from their travels can create additional pressure and disappointment.

Judgment of Emotions: Your expression of loneliness and anxiety suggests a belief that these feelings are somehow unacceptable during a "glamorous" journey. It's essential to recognize that discomfort is a natural part of any transformative experience.

Now, let’s explore how you can reframe these thoughts and embrace your experiences positively:

Redefining Meaning: Instead of viewing your travels as merely a series of Instagram-worthy moments, consider the value of your experiences, even the challenging ones. Each moment, whether joyous or difficult, provides insights and growth opportunities.

Embracing All Emotions: Understand that it’s okay to feel lonely or anxious. Acknowledge these feelings as part of your journey rather than a barrier. They can lead you to deeper self-awareness and connection with yourself.

Personal Exploration: Shift your focus from comparing yourself to others to an exploration of your own desires and motivations. What do you want to seek or learn about yourself in your travels?

Revisiting Your Experience: Reflect on the positive aspects of your journey. The connections you made with fellow travelers and the lessons learned are valuable parts of your story. Keep a journal to capture these reflections; it can offer you perspective and clarity.

Taking Action Again: If you feel a pull to travel once more, consider how you might prepare differently this time. For example, exploring destinations that resonate with your interests or creating a broader itinerary that allows for both exploration and downtime might enhance your experience.

You have shown a remarkable ability to reflect on your experiences, and that alone is a sign of growth and strength. Embrace the journey ahead with an open heart, knowing that every step contributes to your unique life story.
